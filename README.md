## **How to Use This Index**

- **To find a page:**  
  Search for the file path in your codebase. For example, to find the driver dashboard, go to `lib/features/driver/presentation/pages/driver_home_page.dart`.

- **To add a new page:**  
  Place it in the appropriate `presentation/pages/` directory under the relevant feature.

- **To understand navigation:**  
  The main routing logic is in `lib/main.dart` and each feature's main page (e.g., `home_page.dart`, `driver_home_page.dart`) typically acts as the entry point for that role or feature.

---

## **Conventions**

- **Page files** are named `*_page.dart` and reside in `presentation/pages/` folders.
- **Widgets** that are major UI components but not full pages are in `lib/widgets/`.
- **Role-based dashboards** are in their respective feature folders (driver, broker, warehouse).
