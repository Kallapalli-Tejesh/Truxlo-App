# Enhanced Tracking System Requirements

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing tracking system to provide comprehensive real-time location tracking and navigation for both drivers and warehouse owners. The system will show current driver locations, provide route navigation based on job status, implement location permission handling, and ensure proper logging of tracking data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Driver Map Enhancements

**User Story:** As a driver, I want to see my current location on the map when it loads, so that I can understand my position relative to pickup and destination points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the job tracking page loads THEN the system SHALL display the driver's current location on the map
2. WHEN location services are available THEN the system SHALL center the map on the driver's current location
3. WHEN the driver's location updates THEN the system SHALL update the marker position in real-time
4. IF location services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: Status-Based Route Navigation for Drivers

**User Story:** As a driver, I want to see different routes based on my job status, so that I can navigate efficiently to the correct destination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the job status is 'assigned' AND the driver clicks track THEN the system SHALL show the route from driver's current location to pickup location
2. WHEN the job status is 'inTransit' AND the driver clicks navigate THEN the system SHALL show the route from driver's current location to destination
3. WHEN the route is displayed THEN the system SHALL show estimated time and distance
4. WHEN the driver's location changes THEN the system SHALL update the route dynamically

### Requirement 3: Location Permission Management

**User Story:** As a driver, I want to be prompted to enable location services when starting tracking, so that the system can function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the driver clicks 'Start Tracking' AND location services are disabled THEN the system SHALL show an alert to turn on location
2. WHEN the location alert is shown THEN the system SHALL provide a system popup to access location settings
3. WHEN location permission is denied THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message
4. WHEN location permission is granted THEN the system SHALL proceed with tracking initialization

### Requirement 4: Warehouse Owner Tracking Interface

**User Story:** As a warehouse owner, I want to track my assigned drivers' locations and routes, so that I can monitor job progress and provide updates to customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job is in 'assigned' status THEN the active jobs section SHALL display a 'Track Driver Location' button
2. WHEN a job is in 'inTransit' status THEN the active jobs section SHALL display a 'Track Driver' button
3. WHEN the warehouse owner clicks the track button THEN the system SHALL open a map view showing driver location and relevant route
4. WHEN tracking is active THEN the system SHALL update driver location in real-time

### Requirement 5: Assigned Status Tracking for Warehouse Owners

**User Story:** As a warehouse owner, I want to see the driver's current location and route to pickup when a job is assigned, so that I can estimate pickup time and coordinate accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the job status is 'assigned' AND warehouse owner clicks track THEN the system SHALL show driver's current location
2. WHEN displaying assigned job tracking THEN the system SHALL show the route from driver's current location to pickup point
3. WHEN the route is displayed THEN the system SHALL show estimated arrival time at pickup
4. WHEN the driver moves THEN the system SHALL update the route and ETA dynamically

### Requirement 6: In-Transit Status Tracking for Warehouse Owners

**User Story:** As a warehouse owner, I want to see comprehensive tracking information when a job is in transit, so that I can monitor delivery progress and inform customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the job status is 'inTransit' AND warehouse owner clicks track THEN the system SHALL show pickup location, delivery location, and current driver location
2. WHEN displaying in-transit tracking THEN the system SHALL show the route from driver's current location to destination
3. WHEN the tracking view is active THEN the system SHALL display all three locations (pickup, current driver, destination) with appropriate markers
4. WHEN the driver moves THEN the system SHALL update the route and delivery ETA dynamically

### Requirement 7: Tracking Data Logging Verification

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure that all tracking data is properly logged, so that we have accurate records for analytics and dispute resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking is active THEN the system SHALL log driver location updates to the job_tracking_logs table
2. WHEN a location update occurs THEN the system SHALL record latitude, longitude, speed, heading, accuracy, job status, and timestamp
3. WHEN tracking data is logged THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity and proper foreign key relationships
4. WHEN querying tracking logs THEN the system SHALL return accurate historical location data

### Requirement 8: Real-Time Location Updates

**User Story:** As a warehouse owner, I want to see real-time updates of driver locations, so that I can provide accurate information to customers and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a driver is being tracked THEN the system SHALL update their location every 30 seconds
2. WHEN the warehouse owner has a tracking view open THEN the system SHALL refresh driver location automatically
3. WHEN location updates are received THEN the system SHALL update map markers and routes without requiring page refresh
4. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL handle location update failures gracefully

### Requirement 9: Enhanced Map Visualization

**User Story:** As both drivers and warehouse owners, I want clear visual indicators on the map, so that I can easily distinguish between different locations and understand the current situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying locations on the map THEN the system SHALL use distinct markers for pickup (green), destination (red), and driver (blue) locations
2. WHEN showing routes THEN the system SHALL display clear polylines with appropriate colors
3. WHEN multiple locations are shown THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust the map bounds to show all relevant points
4. WHEN the map loads THEN the system SHALL use appropriate zoom levels for optimal visibility

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when location services fail or tracking encounters issues, so that I can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN location services fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN tracking cannot start THEN the system SHALL explain the reason and suggest solutions
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN location permission is required THEN the system SHALL guide users through the permission process
